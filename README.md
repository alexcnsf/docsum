# docsum ![](https://github.com/alexcnsf/docsum/workflows/tests/badge.svg)


I developed a docuemnt summarizier, `docsum.py`,  using GROQ's cutting-edge, low-latency LLM API to summarize documents of any size and text type at great speeds.

## Requirements

All requirements and dependencies are listed in the up-to-date requirements.txt file.
Also remeber to get your own GROQ API key and set it as an enviromental variable

## Usage

Upload a summarize any document you want!

For example:
docsum anasoni$ python3 docsum.py docs/constitution-mx.txt

Final Summary:
Wow, that's a lot of text!

Let me summarize the main points for you:

* The Mexican Constitution is a set of rules that govern Mexico.
* The government is divided into three branches: the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial.
* The Executive branch is headed by the President, who makes decisions and carries out laws.
* The Legislative branch makes laws and approves the President's appointments.
* The Judicial branch interprets laws and settles disputes.
* The government has a system of checks and balances to ensure that no one branch becomes too powerful.
* The Constitution protects individual rights, such as freedom of speech and the right to own property.
* It also establishes rules for the government, its institutions, and its agencies.
* The document outlines the powers and responsibilities of each branch of government.
* It mentions specific issues, like education, healthcare, and labor laws.
* The Constitution was written in 1917 and has undergone changes over the years.
* The text also talks about the government's role in supporting education, healthcare, and social services.
* The Constitution establishes rules for the government's relationship with international organizations and other countries.
* The document outlines the rights and freedoms of Mexican citizens.
* The President of Mexico can send a budget to the Congress, which is a group of elected representatives.
* The budget must be used to benefit the country, and its results will be evaluated.
* Public offices must be open to the public and not biased towards one person or group.
* The Constitution says that certain things, like temples and national properties, are for the good of the country and not for personal gain.

That's it! Let me know if you have any specific questions or if you'd like me to summarize anything else.
